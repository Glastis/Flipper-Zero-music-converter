Convert midi files into fmf

Tested in windows, but I don't see why it wouldn't work in linux as long it's used with python3.9.

Forked from the work of [nemanjan00](https://gist.github.com/nemanjan00), the original script (which is most of the script actually) can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/nemanjan00/591bc3aedbb09a6f8fb623e862232870).

## Prerequisites

Be sure you have python3.9 installed and in your PATH.

## Usage

You can drop one or more midi files into the `drag_here.bat` script to convert them into fmf.

Alternatively, you can start the python file from the command line, it will ask you for the midi file to convert.
